# Zambia_eDNA
This site contains the main code I used for my research (Link coming soon)

This repository includes the main code I used for my environmental DNA research in Zambia for my PhD work.

It includes the script I used for merging and demultiplexing of nanopore and illumina data, scripts for read quality filtering, chimera removal, derreplication and OTU clustering, and a script to perform global aligment on a reference database. I include the original demultiplexing files I used as well as the command parameters used for this study. For more details on software or database versions please refer to my paper (Link coming soon) or write me to dgygax90@gmail.com
